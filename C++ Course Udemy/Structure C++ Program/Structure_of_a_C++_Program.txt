# Preprocessor Directives
Preprocessor is a program that process the source code before the compiler sees it.
Directives start with '#'
Commands tot the Preprocessor
e.g
    #include <iostream>
    #include "myfile.h"

# The main() Function
Every C++ program must have exactly 1 main() Function
Starting point of program execution
Return 0 indicates successful programm execution
2 Versions that are both valid:
    V1
    int main(){
        // code
        return 0;
    }
    V2
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
        // Code
        return 0;
    }

# Namespaces
Names given to parts of code to help reduce naming conflicts
std is the name for the C++ 'standard' Namespace
Third-part frameworks will have their own namespaces
Scope resoultion operator ::
Example
    #include <iostream>

    using namespace std;

    int main(){
        cout << "Enter your favourite number: ";
    }

# Basic I/O using cin and cout
cout:
    standard output stream
    console
cin:
    standard input stream
    keyboard
<<:
    Insertion operator
    Output streams
>>:
    Extraction operator
    Input streams

# cout and <<
Insert the data into the cout stream
    cout << data;
Can be chained
    cout << "data 1 is " << data1;
Does not automatically add line brakes
    cout << "data 1 is " << data1 << endl;
    cout << "data 1 is " << data1 << "\n";

# cin and >>
Extract data from the cin stream based on data's type
    cin >> data;
Can be chained
    cin >> data1 >> data2;
Can fail if the entered data cannot be interpreted
data could have an undermined value
